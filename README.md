- User interactions: Users can like, dislike, and comment on videos. They can also subscribe to channels and receive notifications for new video uploads.
- Recommendations: The application provides personalized video recommendations based on the user's viewing history and preferences.
- User profiles: Users have their own profiles, where they can manage their uploaded videos, playlists, and subscriptions.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to work well on different screen sizes and devices.
